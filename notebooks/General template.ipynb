    "This project uses machine learning and data from the CDC's [2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html) to help a hospital identify patients who would benefit from an educational program about heart health. After model iteration and hyperparameter tuning, our final model can **correctly predict about 81% of the people with a heart condition**, while only mislabeling about 29% of negative cases as positive.
